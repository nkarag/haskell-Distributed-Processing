ISSUE 1
when issued a :
	stack new IOHK-test
command, I got an error: AesonException "Error in $.packages.cassava.constraints.flags['bytestring--lt-0_10_4']: Invalid flag name: \"bytestring--lt-0_10_4\""

I googled it and discovered (https://github.com/fpco/stackage/issues/3132) that I had to do a : 
	stack upgrade
I have upgraded fron v1.3 to v1.6.5

ISSUE 2

then when I cd-ed into the new dir and tried to run : stack init
I got another error:

"You seem to be using a legacy 00-index.tar.gz tarball.
Consider changing your configuration to use a 01-index.tar.gz file.
Alternatively, you can set the ignore-revision-mismatch setting to true.
For more information, see: https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/3520"

So according to: 

https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/cbf798646ffc402dfd3ab5374a4e06c166a82096/doc/yaml_configuration.md

I have edited the stack.yaml configuration file (at the OS user level), i.e., the one at: ~/.stack/config.yaml

to point at 01-index.tar.gz instead of 00-index.tar.gz
